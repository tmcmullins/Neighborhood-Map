# P2_Neighborhood_Map

Udacity FEND Advanced Interactivity Neighborhood Map

## Project Overview

You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Initiate

Navigate to the root folder of this app and open index.html in any web browser. Alternatively, you can always visit <https://tmcmullins.github.io/P2_Neighborhood_Map>

## Basic Operation

Search Yelp for places to visit in the greater Los Angeles area. I have included some of my favorite places to visit as well. Feel free to add or take away any location of your choosing by clicking the "-" or "+" to the left of the name.

Click on the name of the place in the menu and the map will zoom in and center on the select location. Click on the marker to reveal more information about the selected location.
